//a) C is often referred to as the mother of all programming language because it is one of the most popular programming languages.
//Right from the time,it was developed, C has become the most widely used and preferred programming languages.
//Most of the compilers and kernels are written in C today.

source code: Source code is the list of human readable instructions that a programmer writes often in a word processing program—when he is developing a program. The source code is run through a compiler to turn it into machine code,
also called object code, that a computer can understand and execute. Object code consists primarily of 1s and 0s, so it isn't human-readable.

.obj file:  An OBJ file is a standard 3D image format that can be exported and opened by various 3D image editing programs.
It contains a three-dimensional object, including 3D coordinates, texture maps, polygonal faces,
and other object information. OBJ files may also store references to one or more .MTL files that contain surface shading material for the object.

.exe file:  A file with the EXE file extension is an executable file used in operating systems like Windows, MS-DOS, OpenVMS,
and ReactOS for opening software programs.

Recursion comes from word recurrence, which means coming again and again! Basically, whenever we define a term using that very term,
or in other words, whenever the problem re-occurs inside solution definition, then that problem can be solved using recursion methods.
example: when we talk of getting factorial of a method.
